    <h2>What is XRP?</h2>
    <p>
      XRP is a digital asset built for payments, developed by Ripple Labs. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, XRP is not mined; 
      it was pre-mined and distributed by Ripple, making it a more centralized option in the crypto space.
    </p>

    <p>
      XRP is designed to enable fast, low-cost international money transfers. It settles transactions in 3â€“5 seconds and 
      can handle 1,500 transactions per second (TPS), making it one of the fastest cryptocurrencies in the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ripple's goal is to work with financial institutions and banks to improve cross-border payment systems through 
      technologies like RippleNet and the XRP Ledger. XRP acts as a bridge currency in transactions and helps minimize liquidity costs.
