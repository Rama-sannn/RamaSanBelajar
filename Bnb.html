    <h2>What is Binance Coin?</h2>
    <p>
      Binance Coin (BNB) is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance exchange, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.
      Initially launched as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, BNB migrated to its own blockchain, Binance Chain, in 2019.
      It is used primarily to pay for transaction fees on Binanceâ€™s exchange and within its ecosystem. BNB has multiple uses including trading, 
      staking, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, making it a versatile asset in the crypto world.
    </p>

    <p>
      Binance Coin follows a deflationary model where Binance uses a portion of its profits to buy back and burn BNB tokens every quarter, 
      reducing the total supply and theoretically increasing the value of the remaining tokens over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the rise of Binance Smart Chain (BSC), BNB has also gained adoption as a key asset for decentralized applications (dApps), 
      decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and DeFi protocols. BNB continues to grow in both use cases and value as the Binance ecosystem expands.
